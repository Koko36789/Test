## 1.2 Programming language
Python is used in the project. The task required us to use Python. Besides that, there are some advantange of Python over other programming languages.
- Easy to use
  - Python has a simple syntax compared to other programming language e.g. C++ and Java.
  - Python is many built in modules. We can use the modules so save our time.
- Large community
  - There are many unofficial libraries made by various people online. Also, we can easily download them using command prompt, e.g.
  ```
  pip install XXX

Pygame is the only external library that I have used.
